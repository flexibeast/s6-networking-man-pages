.Sh NAME
.Nm s6-tcpserver4-socketbinder
.Nd bind an INET domain socket to an IPv4 address and port, then execute a program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d | Fl D
.Op Fl b Ar backlog
.Op Fl M | Fl m
.Op Fl B
.Ar ip
.Ar port
.Ar prog...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates a TCP socket and binds it to IPv4 address
.Ar ip ,
port
.Ar port .
It prepares the socket to accept connections by calling
.Xr listen 2 .
.Pp
It then
.Xr exec 3
s into
.Ar prog...
with the open socket as its standard input.
.Pp
The socket is provided
.Sy non-blocking by default .
.Pp
.Nm
is part of a set of basic blocks used to build a flexible TCP/IPv4
super-server.
It normally should be given a command line crafted to make it execute
into
.Xr s6-tcpserver4d 1
to accept connections from clients, or into a program such as
.Xr s6-applyuidgid 1
to drop privileges before doing so.
.Pp
The
.Xr s6-tcpserver4 1
program does exactly this.
It implements a full TCP/IPv4 super-server by building a command line
starting with
.Nm
and ending with
.Xr s6-tcpserver4d 1
followed by the application program, and executing into it.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Fl d
Allow instant rebinding to the same IP and port even if it has been
used not long ago - this is the
.Dv SO_REUSEADDR
flag to
.Xr setsockopt 2
and is generally used with server programs.
This is the default.
.It Fl D
Disallow instant rebinding to the same path.
.It Fl b Ar backlog
Set a maximum of
.Ar backlog
backlog connections on the socket - extra connection attempts will
rejected by the kernel.
The default is
.Dv SOMAXCONN ,
i.e. the maximum number allowed by the system.
If
.Ar backlog
is 0, then the socket will be created, but it
.Sy will not be listening .
.It Fl M
Create a TCP socket.
This is the default.
.It Fl m
Create a UDP socket.
Note that by default UDP sockets are not connection-mode, and
.Xr listen 2
will fail - so you should always give the
.Ql -b0
option to
.Nm
along with
.Ql -m .
.It Fl B
Create a blocking socket.
Default is non-blocking.
