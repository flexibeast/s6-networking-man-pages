.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
accepts connections from clients, and forks a program to handle each connection.
.Pp
.Nm
binds to local IPv4 address
.Ar ip ,
port
.Ar port .
.Pp
It closes its stdin and stdout.
.Pp
For every TCP connection to this address and port, it forks.
The child sets some environment variables, then executes
.Ar prog...
with stdin reading from the network socket and stdout writing to it.
.Pp
Depending on the verbosity level, it logs what it does to stderr.
.Pp
It runs until killed by a signal.
Depending on the received signal, it may kill its children before
exiting.
.Pp
.Nm
actually doesn't do any of this itself.
It is a wrapper, rewriting the command line and executing into a chain
of programs that perform those duties.
.Pp
Unlike its ancestor tcpserver[1],
.Nm
performs just the bare minimum: the point is to have a very small and
very fast process to serve connections with the least possible
overhead.
Features such as additional environment variables, access control and
DNS resolution are provided via the
.Xr s6-tcpserver-access 1
program.
.Pp
In previous releases of s6-networking,
.Nm
was monolithic: it did the work of
.Xr s6-tcpserver4-socketbinder 1 ,
.Xr s6-applyuidgid 1
and
.Xr s6-tcpserver4d 1
itself.
The functionality has now been split into several different programs
because some service startup schemes require the daemon to get its
socket from an external program instead of creating and binding it
itself.
The most obvious application of this is upgrading a long-lived process
without losing existing connections.
.Ss Signals
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Dv SIGTERM
Exit.
.It Dv SIGHUP
Send a
.Dv SIGTERM
and a
.Dv SIGCONT
to all children.
.It SIGQUIT
Send a
.Dv SIGTERM
and a
.Dv SIGCONT
to all children, then exit.
.It SIGABRT
Send a
.Dv SIGKILL
to all children, then exit.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Fl 1
write
.Ar port
to stdout, before closing it, right after binding and listening to the
network socket.
If stdout is suitably redirected, this can be used by monitoring
programs to check when the server is ready to accept connections.
.It Fl v Ar verbosity
Be more or less verbose.
By default,
.Ar verbosity
is 1: print warning messages to stderr.
0 means only print fatal error messages; 2 means print status and
connection information for every client.
.It Fl c Ar maxconn
Accept at most
.Ar maxconn
concurrent connections.
Default is 40.
It is impossible to set it higher than 1000.
.It Fl C Ar localmaxconn
Accept at most
.Ar localmaxconn
connections from the same IP address.
Default is 40.
It is impossible to set it higher than
.Ar maxconn .
.It Fl b Ar backlog
Set a maximum of
.Ar backlog
backlog connections on the socket.
Extra connection attempts will rejected by the kernel.
.It Fl G Ar gidlist
Change
.Nm Ap
s supplementary group list to
.Ar gidlist
after binding the socket.
This is only valid when run as root.
.Ar gidlist
must be a comma-separated list of numerical group IDs.
.It Fl g Ar gid
Change
.Nm Ap
s group id to
.Ar gid
after binding the socket.
This is only valid when run as root.
.It Fl u Ar uid
Change
.Nm Ap
s user id
to
.Ar uid
after binding the socket.
This is only valid when run as root.
.It Fl U
Change
.Nm Ap
s user id, group id and supplementary group list according to the
values of the
.Ev UID ,
.Ev GID
and
.Ev GIDLIST
environment variables after binding the socket.
This is only valid when run as root.
This can be used with the
.Xr s6-envuidgid 1
program to easily script a service that binds to a privileged socket
then drops its privileges to those of a named non-root account.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
For each connection, an instance of
.Ar prog...
is spawned with
the following variables set:
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Ev PROTO
Always set to TCP.
.It Ev TCPREMOTEIP
Set to the originating address.
.It Ev TCPREMOTEPORT
Set to the originating port.
.It Ev TCPCONNNUM
Set to the number of connections originating from the same IP address.
